## 📝 Security Notice

This is a **personal-use implementation** with good security practices. For enterprise deployment, consider:
- Audit by security professional
- Advanced encryption (end-to-end)
- Rate limiting
- Security logging
- Regular penetration testing
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

## 📦 Repository Notes

- **Git layout**: `client/` is its own local Git repository (created by Create React App) and is tracked by the parent repo as a git link with **no remote configured**. If you clone the parent repo and `client/` appears empty, restore it from the existing checkout or re-`git add` it as a regular directory.
- **Same-origin API**: the frontend defaults to the relative `/api` path, so a single deployment (Vercel, or the Express server serving the built React app) works without extra configuration. Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` only if the API is hosted separately.
- **Secrets**: `JWT_SECRET` and `ENCRYPTION_KEY` are required in production — the server fails fast if they are missing. Never commit `.env` files.
